# STEM2024 - SCHOOL PROJECT


Hello, dear reader.
I built this in 2024 for my stem school project.
Anyways, here's how to open and run it.

You don't need any package managers like `npm` or `pnpm` since this entire codebase is just HTML and CSS (I'm also not using any JavaScript) to make this easier to code and debug, and less bloated.

## How to install/run this:

### Linux/BSD/MacOS/POSIX-compatible:
  Open your favourite terminal emulator or just use a tty, and execute these commands in your home directory as a non-root user *(NOTE): git needs to be installed*:
  
  
  `git clone https://github.com/HambOrig/stem2024.git ./`
  
  `cd ./stem2024`
  
  `ls`
  

### NT/Windows 7-11
  In your web browser, got to git-scm's [homepage](https://git-scm.com), and follow the instructions to download.
  
  Press 🪟 + R
  
  type `cmd` into the box

  press enter

  Enter these commands:
  
  `git clone https://github.com/HambOrig/stem2024.git`
  
  `cd ./stem2024`
  
  `dir`
  
  `[WEB-BROWSER] ./index.html`


## How to edit this:

  To edit this, rather than using your OS's built in `code editor`, I would reccomend you use one of these (all of these have POSIX-compatible, NT-Windows and MacOS versions):

  1. [VS Codeium](https://vscodium.com/#install)

  2. [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

  3. [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
